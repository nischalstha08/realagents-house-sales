# RealAgents: House Sales Prediction

This project is part of a DataCamp practical exam for the Data Scientist Associate certification. It involves analyzing house sales data and building predictive models to optimize listing prices.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:
- `house_sales.csv` - Contains 1500 homes with various features.
- `train.csv` - Training dataset with 1200 homes.
- `validation.csv` - Validation dataset with 300 homes.

## Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values in `house_sales.csv`
- Transformed categorical variables
- Standardized data formats

## Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

## Results

- The models were evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
- RMSE was found to be **less than 30,000**, meeting the initial condition.

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
